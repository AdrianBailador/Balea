Delegate Permissions to another Person
======================================

In role-based access model, delegation involves delegating roles to another users that can assume a set of permissions to access to the resources on behalf of the user. Balea supports the delegation of your permissions to another person. This article shows you how to configure Balea in order to use delegations.

Defining delegations
--------------------

To delegate permissions to another user you must configure:

- **who:** User (Subject id) who delegates permissions.
- **whom:** User (Subject id) to delegating.
- **from:** The date when delegation starts.
- **to:** The date when delegation finish.
- **selected:** If the user is acting on behalf of (Only one should be selected, if there are more than one selected, Bale select the first one the user have selected).

An example of delegation::

        {
          "Balea": {
            "applications": [
              {
                "name": "default",
                "roles": [],
                "delegations": [
                  {
                    "who": "1",
                    "whom": "2",
                    "from": "2020-01-15 00:00:00",
                    "to": "2020-12-31 23:59:59",
                    "selected": true
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
